@0    = ~Hi folks, welcome to Crazy Eddie's, where the prices are so low there's gotta be something wrong. Nobody sells it lower than me, because nobody buys it cheaper. If you can find a price lower than mine this side of Athkatla, the item will probably kill you. What can I get for you?~
@1    = ~So you've got the cheapest goods around? Let's have a look.~
@2    = ~No thanks. You get what you pay for.~
