@0    = ~You there!  This shop is closed!  It is late at night, and I can see that Ribald the owner is not with you.  Obviously, you must be a thief breaking and entering!~
@1    = ~I am going to have to place you under arrest.  You can come with me and my men where you will await a fair trial, or we will have to take you by force.  What will it be?~
@2    = ~Okay Officer.  I'll come with you.~
@3    = ~You'll never take me alive!~
@4    = ~You were charged with the crime of breaking and entering.  Add murder to the list of crimes.  I insist that you either come with us *NOW*, or you will be executed here.~
@5    = ~You made the right choice.~
@6    = ~You just don't learn, do you?~
