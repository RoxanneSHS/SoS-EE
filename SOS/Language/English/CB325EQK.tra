@0    = ~As you move deeper into the underground caverns and tunnels, signs of collapse are more than obvious.~

@2    = ~The damage that the Tremor Worms are causing to the integrity of the natural caverns and tunnels bothers you more than the bruises. bites, and cuts they have given you.

@4    = ~Perhaps it would be wise to turn back, return to Soubar and make a direct assault on the castle's walls.~
@5    = ~A powerful aftershock rocks the area.  You huddle with your companions along the edges of the tunnel walls, hoping to avoid any falling rocks or cave-ins.~
@6    = ~A powerful aftershock rocks the area.  You huddle along the edge of the cavern's wall, hoping to avoid any falling rocks or cave-ins.~
