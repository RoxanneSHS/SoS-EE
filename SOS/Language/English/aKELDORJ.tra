@0    = ~I must agree with the good cleric, Anomen.  If the good Lord Barterman desires to profit from the sale of any goods, then it is our duty not to steal from him or betray the trust he extended to you upon your arrival in Athkatla.~
@1    = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, our honor and reputation are on the line.  Let not Tyr the God of Justice balance his scales with your chaotic deeds.~
@2    = ~Let us leave this place now, and seek an alternative to stealing.  Perhaps we can purchase the goods outright from Mister Barterman.~
@3    = ~This is not right, <CHARNAME>.  The path of honor dictates that thou shalt not steal, and that is exactly what you are planning.~
@4    = ~I pray that you change your course, <CHARNAME>, before the Order or Tyr imposes its own sense of justice upon us for such criminal acts.~
@5    = ~Betra.  Poor lass.  She reminded me of my own girl, Vesper.  <CHARNAME>, the violence that that beast caused to the poor girl is unforgivable.  It is good that you killed it.~
@6    = ~Come, we should leave this house.  It is not fit for habitation any longer.~
