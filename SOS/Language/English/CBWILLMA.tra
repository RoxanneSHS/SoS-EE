@0    = ~Who are you?  What are you doing here?  Where's Galvena?~
@1    = ~I killed Galvena.  And I will kill you too if you don't tell me what I need to know.~
@2    = ~I don't know who or where this Galvena is.~
@3    = ~Who I am doesn't matter.  I'm here on behalf of Selence Hillstar.  She said you owe her money.  Is that true?~
@4    = ~What's your relationship with Galvena?~
@5    = ~What's your relationship with Selence Hillstar?~
@6    = ~You WHAT???  You killed my 'one and only' love?  I shall avenge her!~
@7    = ~She must be upstairs with a client or one of the girls.  I will go find her then.~
@8    = ~Just a moment.  What's your relationship with Galvena?~
@9    = ~Just a moment.  What's your relationship with Selence Hillstar?~
@10   = ~I am an important noble in Amn.  I will not discuss my personal affairs with a common adventurer.~
@11   = ~Selence?  That woman is nothing more than a greedy thief who thinks to get money from me that she does not deserve.~
@12   = ~Did she tell you that?  That lying thief.~
@13   = ~Of course I don't owe her money.  If anyone owes money, it's her who owes me money.  Enormous amounts of gold she has nearly stolen right out of my pockets.~
@14   = ~I am an important noble in Amn.  I shall not discuss my personal affairs with a common adventurer.~
@15   = ~Selence?  That woman is nothing more than a greedy thief.  And I wish I had never involved myself with her.  Now, if you will excuse me...~
@16   = ~She told me you owe her money.  Is that true?~
@17   = ~Look, I told you I didn't want to talk to you about my personal affairs.  Now leave me alone.~
@18   = ~I might be able to help, if I knew what was going on.~
@19   = ~I need to get Selence her money.  However I do it makes no difference to me.~
@20   = ~I can't.  It's too embarassing.  The truth would ruin me.  That's why I had Selence do what she did.  Though I wish I hadn't.~
@21   = ~What can I do to make things right?  I really need to get her money, and I don't know what is going on.~
@22   = ~I don't think there is anything anyone can do to make this right.  It was my mistake, I tried to fix it, and now things have gone terribly wrong.~
@23   = ~I will tell you the story, but you must promise that you won't tell anyone else.  Especially not Bylanna Lanulin.~
@24   = ~Who's Bylanna Lanulin?~
@25   = ~She's the Magistrate of Athkatla.  She's also my wife.~
@26   = ~Your wife is the Magistrate?  Then what's all this with Galvena?~
@27   = ~Come now, even you can't be that naive.  Do I really need to explain it to you?~
@28   = ~Yes.  Please.  I want to hear you admit the truth.~
@29   = ~Galvena is my lover.  Bylanna is my wife.  Selence is a nosy thief.~
@30   = ~Somehow, Selence found out I was having an affair.  I think one of those pirates out there told her.  But it doesn't matter anymore.~
@31   = ~Now, that greedy gossip monger of a thief keeps telling me that I should pay her, or she'll pass word along to Bylanna of my...ah.. indiscretion.~
@32   = ~I fear Bylanna may find out anyway.  She is sure to notice that we are spending more money that I've actually been putting in the account books.  All the money I've been giving Selence is not hard to miss.~
@33   = ~So what will Bylanna do if she finds out?  Does Galvena know you are married?~
@34   = ~You've got yourself into this mess.  Just like a man.  You get yourself out.  I don't care how.  But you will be paying Selence.~
@35   = ~I suppose I could try to help you out.~
@36   = ~I've paid more than enough for her services.  I thought the truth would ruin me.  Now I think I would have been better if word had got out in the first place.~
@37   = ~Are you joking?!?  Bylanna would castrate me.  And of course Galvena doesn't know I'm married.~
@38   = ~Then it sounds like you only have one choice.  Keep lying.~
@39   = ~Lying?  To who?~
@40   = ~To everyone.  Galvena.  Bylanna.  Selence.  Well, not really Selence, but she's a woman too.  The best way to keep lying is to cover your tracks.  Pay off Selence.  Raise the money you give to Selence somewhere that you won't have a trail.~
@41   = ~That might just work....  But how am I to get money where it can't be traced?~
@42   = ~You could go adventuring.  On second thought, your legs have too much in common with a chicken for you to be an adventurer.~
@43   = ~I'm sure you could find a gambling house somewhere.  The Blushing Mermaid Tavern in Baldur's Gate has some nice gaming tables.~
@44   = ~Why not compete with Selence?  Start up your own network of thieves or something.~
@45   = ~You could go into Galvena's line of work.~
@46   = ~No, I'm no adventurer.  But I know how I can raise the money.~
@47   = ~Good.  So are you going to pay Selence?~
@48   = ~I don't seem to have any other choice.~
@49   = ~Since you know Selence, you'll have to take the money to her.  But I don't have it with me.  You need to go back to my villa in Athkatla and pick it up.~
@50   = ~I keep it hidden in a safe behind a wall tapestry.  There should be just over twenty-thousand gold pieces there.  You can give them to Selence.~
@51   = ~Here's the key for the safe.  Just leave it on the table near the safe when you're through.  I'll get it when I'm back in the city.~
@52   = ~And you can tell that blackmailing bitch that she won't get away with this for much longer.~
@53   = ~I don't think I'm lucky enough to gamble.  But I know how I can raise the money.~
@54   = ~No, I think that if Bylanna found out about that, I'd be in even worse trouble.  But I know how I can raise some money.~
@55   = ~Become a lady of the night?  But I'm not a lady.~
@56   = ~I meant a... ah... a businessman.  Hire your own ladies.~
@57   = ~No, I don't think I'm quite cut out to be a mada....er...what's a male madame called?  No matter.  I think I know how to raise some money.~
@58   = ~Not anymore.  I'm done with that blackmailing bitch.  You go find her and tell her that she can go visit Cyric.~
@59   = ~And that she won't be getting one more copper from me while I'm still alive.~
@60   = ~That would indeed be helpful.  What do you suggest?~
@61   = ~Well, what would Bylanna do if she found out?  Does Galvena know you are married?~
@62   = ~I already told you.  I'm not going to pay Selence.  I don't care if she tells everyone about Galvena and I.  I'm not going to be blackmailed any more.~
@63   = ~I need to pay Hillstar the money you may or may not owe her.  If you don't give me the key to your safe, I'll have to kill you now.~
@64   = ~Just give me the key to your safe, and I don't care what you do with Selence, Bylanna, or Galvena.~
@65   = ~Now, if you will excuse me...~
@66   = ~I wish I had never decided to involve myself with her.~
@67   = ~That thief is nothing more than a blackmailer.~
@68   = ~Blackmail?  Selence never told me anything about blackmail?  What is this all about?~
@69   = ~I am an important noble in Amn.  I do not need to be blackmailed or threatened.  I can take care of myself.  If you insist on threatening me, I shall have to respond to your insults.~
@70   = ~I'll take the key from your corpse if I have to.~
@71   = ~Fine.  Here.  Take the key and stay out of my affairs.~
@72   = ~I've had enough of your threats.  You won't get away with such vagrant insults.~
@73   = ~I told you to stay out of my affairs.  I am an important noble in Amn and do not need to speak to the likes of a blackmailer's associate.~
@74   = ~Leave me alone.~
